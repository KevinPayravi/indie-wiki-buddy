      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Indie Wiki Buddy provides a suite of features to help you discover independent wikis and improve your general
        wiki reading experience.
        <br /><br />
        When you visit a wiki on a large, corporate-run wiki host, this extension can notify or automatically redirect
        you to quality independent wikis when they're available.
        Search results in Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, Brave Search, Ecosia, Startpage, Qwant, Yandex, Kagi, SearXNG, and Whoogle can also be filtered,
        replacing non-independent wikis with links to independent counterpart (or hiding them completely).
        <br /><br />
        We currently redirect from Fandom, Fextralife, and Neoseeker wikis to independent counterparts.
        <br /><br />
        Indie Wiki Buddy also supports <a href="https://breezewiki.com/">BreezeWiki</a>, a separate service that renders
        Fandom wikis without ads or bloat.
        This helps give you a more enjoyable reading experience when an independent wiki isn't available.
        <br /><br />
        All these features can be toggled on or off, and you can set your preferences per-wiki as well. You're in full
        control!
      </p>
      <h2>Global settings help</h2>
      <p>
        There are several global settings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b><span aria-hidden="true">🔋</span> Extension is on/off</b>
          <br />
          Enable/disable all Indie Wiki Buddy functionality at the click of a button.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b><span aria-hidden="true">🔔</span> Desktop notifications for redirections</b>
          <br />
          When this option is enabled, you will receive a desktop notification whenever you are
          automatically redirected to either an indie wiki or <a href="https://breezewiki.com/">BreezeWiki</a>.
          This is on by default.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you aren't getting notifications when this is enabled, check your operating system's notification
          settings to ensure that your browser is allowed to send notifications.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b><span aria-hidden="true">🔔</span> On search engines, show banner when non-indie results are hidden</b>
          <br />
          When this option is enabled, a banner will be inserted at the top of search engine results when Indie Wiki
          Buddy
          has hidden results from Fandom, Fextralife, or Neoseeker wikis.
          This banner also lets you re-show the hidden results if you wish.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you don't want to see any indication that results have been hidden, disable this option.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b><span aria-hidden="true">🌐</span> Redirect non-English Fandom wikis to
            indie English wikis there is no same-lang wiki</b>
          <br />
          By default, Indie Wiki Buddy will keep users within the same language
          (e.g. only redirecting Spanish Fandom wikis to Spanish indie wikis).
          However, multilingual speakers may want to also use the many independent English wikis that are available.
          Enabling this option will redirect from non-English Fandom wikis
          to independent English wikis when one isn't available in the same language.
          <br /><br />
          Unfortunately this feature does not currently work for Fextralife wikis.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b><img src="../../images/toggle-replace.png" height="12" alt="" /> On Google, move indie wiki results to the top of
            search results</b>
          <br />
          By default, Indie Wiki Buddy will re-order the results page on Google to move indie wiki results to the top,
          if they are further down the first page of results. This allows you to find the pages you're looking for
          quicker.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b><span aria-hidden="true">📁</span> Open changelog when Indie Wiki Buddy is updated</b>
          <br />
          By default, when Indie Wiki Buddy is updated, the <a href="https://getindie.wiki/changelog/">changelog</a>
          will be opened in a new tab. Unchecking this option will disable opening the changelog.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can also set your desired setting for <a href="https://breezewiki.com/">BreezeWiki</a>,
        a separate service that renders Fandom wikis without ads or bloat.
        Note, BreezeWiki currently only supports English wikis.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b><img src="../../images/toggle-disabled.png" alt="" width="15"> BreezeWiki off</b>
          <br />
          Do not redirect Fandom to BreezeWiki.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b><img src="../../images/toggle-alert.png" alt="" width="15"> Insert banner link to take you to
            BreezeWiki</b>
          <br />
          At the top of English Fandom wikis, a small banner will be inserted with a link to take you to the BreezeWiki
          wiki.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b><img src="../../images/toggle-redirect.png" alt="" width="15"> Automatically redirect Fandom to
            BreezeWiki</b>
          <br />
          Visiting any English Fandom wiki will immediately redirect you to view it through BreezeWiki.
          If automatic redirect to an independent wiki is enabled, the indepedent wiki will take priority.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Once you've enabled a BreezeWiki option,
        a dropdown will appear allowing you to select your preferred BreezeWiki host/mirror.
      </p>

      <h2>Individual wiki settings help</h2>
      <p>
        In the individual settings section of the <a href="../settings/index.html" target="_blank">settings</a> page,
        you can
        configure your settings per-wiki.
        You can refer to the legend or hover over the icons to learn what each column controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first set of radio buttons controls what happens when you visit the listed non-indie wikis.
      </p>
      <ul class="no-markers">
        <li>
          <img src="../../images/toggle-disabled.png" alt="" width="15">
          <b>Disable</b>: You will be neither notified of nor redirected to the independent counterpart.
          You will still be directed to BreezeWiki if it is turned on.
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="../../images/toggle-redirect.png" alt="" width="15">
          <b>Redirect</b>: Be automatically redirected to the independent counterpart.
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="../../images/toggle-alert.png" alt="" width="15">
          <b>Alert</b>: Have a display banner at the top notifying you that an independent wiki is available.
          This will appear on both Fandom and BreezeWiki pages.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The second set of radio buttons controls what happens to the non-indie wiki on Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and
        other search engines.
      </p>
      <ul class="no-markers">
        <li>
          <img src="../../images/toggle-disabled.png" alt="" width="15">
          <b>Disable</b>: Search engine results are not affected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="../../images/toggle-hide.png" alt="" width="15">
          <b>Hide</b>: Results are hidden in search engines.
          A banner will be shown near the top of the page to inform you, and allow you to re-reveal the hidden results.
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src="../../images/toggle-replace.png" alt="" width="15">
          <b>Replace</b>: The original non-indie result is disabled, and a button is injected above to take you to the
          indepedent wiki.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the table header, clicking on the icons will apply that setting to all wikis in the table.
        In the second row, the stars represent the default settings for wikis that are added in future updates.
        By default, all wikis will be set to alert, with search engine replacement enabled.
      </p>
