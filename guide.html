        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Indie Wiki Buddy provides a suite of features to help you discover independent wikis and improve your general wiki reading experience.
          <br /><br />
          When you visit a wiki on a large, corporate-run wiki host, this extension can notify or automatically redirect you to quality independent wikis when they're available.
          Search results in Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, Brave Search, Ecosia, and Startpage can also be filtered,
          replacing non-independent wikis with links to independent counterpart (or hiding them completely).
          <br /><br />
          We currently redirect from Fandom and Fextralife wikis to independent counterparts.
          <br /><br />
          Indie Wiki Buddy also supports <a href="https://breezewiki.com/">BreezeWiki</a>, a separate service that renders Fandom wikis without ads or bloat.
          This helps give you a more enjoyable reading experience when an independent wiki isn't available.
          <br /><br />
          All these features can be toggled on or off, and you can set your preferences per-wiki as well. You're in full control!
        </p>
        <h2>Global settings help</h2>
        <p>
          There are four global settings options:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Extension is on/off</b>
            <br />
            This allows you to enable/disable all Indie Wiki Buddy functionality at the click of a button.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>🔎 Search engine options</b>
            <br />
            Indie Wiki Buddy provides two ways to filter results from
            Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, Brave Search, Ecosia, and Startpage.
            <br />
            <br />
            When "disable non-indie wikis & add link to indie counterparts" is selected,
            tracked Fandom and Fextralife wikis that appear in search engine results
            will be disabled, and a button will be inserted above that attempts to
            link you to the same article on the respective indie wiki.
            <br />
            <br />
            When "hide non-indie wikis that have indie counterparts" is selected,
            the results are completely hidden. A notice will be inserted at the top of the search page
            letting you know that results were hidden, and you will have the option to temporarily
            re-reveal the results or disable search engine filtering for that particular wiki.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you don't want a particular Fandom or Fextralife wiki to be filtered from search results,
            you can disable search engine filtering per-wiki on the full settings page.
            <br />
            <br />
            Note that image results are not filtered;
            we don't want users to miss out on images they might not find elsewhere!
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>🔔 Desktop notifications when redirected to an indie wiki or BreezeWiki</b>
            <br />
            When this option is enabled, you will receive a desktop notification whenever you are
            automatically redirected to either an indie wiki or <a href="https://breezewiki.com/">BreezeWiki</a>.
            This is on by default.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you aren't getting notifications when this is enabled, check your operating system's notification
            settings to ensure that your browser is allowed to send notifications.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>🌬️ Use BreezeWiki on Fandom</b>
            <br />
            This option will render Fandom wikis through <a href="https://breezewiki.com/">BreezeWiki</a>, an external service that removes clutter, simplifies the page, and removes ads.
            Occasionally, BreezeWiki or one of its mirrors may go down; when this happens, you can simply switch to another working instance. This is off by default.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Individual wiki settings help</h2>
        <p>
          In the individual settings section, you can configure your settings per-wiki.
          <br />
          <br />
          The first dropdown lets you switch between lists of wikis in different languages.
          <br />
          <br />
          Below that is a list of all supported wikis (listed as "non-indie wiki » indie wiki"). You can select what happens whenever you visit each listed non-indie wiki.
        </p>
        <ul class="no-markers">
          <li>
            <img src="./images/toggle-disabled.png" alt="" width="15">
            <b>Disable</b>: You will be neither notified of nor redirected to the independent counterpart.
            You will still be directed to BreezeWiki if it is turned on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="./images/toggle-redirect.png" alt="" width="15">
            <b>Redirect</b>: Be automatically redirected to the independent counterpart.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="./images/toggle-alert.png" alt="" width="15">
            <b>Alert</b>: Have a display banner at the top notifying you that an independent wiki is available.
            This will appear on both Fandom and BreezeWiki pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="./images/toggle-search-filter.png" alt="" width="15">
            <b>Search filtering</b>: Replace search results in Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and other search engines
            with text inviting you to visit the independent wiki.
            Oftentimes, the non-independent wiki should appear in that same search.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By default, all wikis will be set to alert with search filtering enabled.
          You can quickly change the settings for all wikis in the current language view by using the control
          buttons above the list of wikis. For example, if you want to be automatically redirect for all wikis,
          click "Set all to redirect to indie wikis".
          <br /><br />
          Once you click on one of these "select all" buttons, that settings
          will become the new default for any wikis that are added to the extension in the future.
        </p>
